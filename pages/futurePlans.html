                              Even though I met a lot of people in north Africa, this guy
                              really sticked out the most. Police officer by profession, good
                              father, devout muslim  and a frendly host, Abdul and his family have really
                              showed me what true morrocan hospitality and tradition looks like
                              when I visited city of Casablanca.

                        In Casablanca, north african city where arab and european architecture
                        and influence meet, I've stayed for a few days at my couch surfing host Abdul Khabib.
                        He and his wife live in two room apartment in the center of the city with
                        their 7 year old son Mohamed. He and his wife during the Arab spring in Egypt
                        and have moved here because of better life standard. They showed me city's beautiful
                        landmarks, from whih Hasan II mosque has been the biggest and most memorable.
                        Then in the evening we went to some bars and night clubs where I experienced the 
                        vibrane casablancan night life and met lots of very interesting people.

                    Mohamed was born in Egypt as youngest in family of six. He experienced a lot of
                    turmoil in his country like war with Israel when he was young, and Arab spring more 
                    recently. He said that Alah helped him to overcome those hard times which were
                    even harder due to his personal problems and big family which had to be feed. Thats
                    why now he comes almost every day to pray in this mosque to express graditude to
                    Allah who helped him through the darkest of times.

                        point of view, all those things Paris is known for wouldn't be impressive at all. That
                        Parisian was Angelina. She showed me lots of local caffes, and told me the story for each of them.
                        She told me stories like, what famous singer, philosopher, etc. has regulary visited those caffes and 
                        what exiting things have happened there. She also showed me some less known museums which were even more 
                        interesting than those more famous ones.
