                        So, you’re ready for your first solo trip? 
                        You’ve got all of your travel essentials, 
                        the perfect hotel, and your flight is booked. 
                        There’s only one thing left to conquer: your 
                        first time flying alone. Perhaps you haven’t 
                        even gotten this far because the idea of flying 
                        alone for the first time has put you off.
                        <br><br>
                        I know how you feel, trust me. We’ve all 
                        been there, and everyone is scared of flying 
                        before they’ve done it. The main thing to 
                        remember is to be prepared. This is my best 
                        advice for you! If you know everything to expect, 
                        from packing, to dealing with luggage restrictions 
                        and beyond, your first flight will be a breeze.
                        <br><br>
                        Here you’ll find all the tips for travelling 
                        abroad first time and everything you need to
                        be ready for your first time flying alone. 
                        It’s time to get out there and see the world!
                        <br><br>
                        First things first, make sure your flight and pick-up by your hotel is sorted. I always use Skyscanner to find the cheapest and best flights, and booking.com to find great and affordable hotels. Once you’ve picked your flight and booked your ticket and luggage, make sure you note down your flight details for your pick-up.

                        There’s nothing worse than arriving at your destination, particularly for your first time solo travel, and not knowing where to go or what to do. That’s how you end up spending a lot on an airport taxi.

                        This is what to do: Contact your hotel, give them your flight time and number and say you’d like to be picked up. They’ll then tell you where they’ll be and usually have a sign with your name on in the arrival hall. 
                        <h4>Book a seat</h4>

                        When you book your flight, you’ll be prompted to book a seat. This will usually cost more if it’s a budget airline. Since you’re flying alone for the first time, you don’t have to worry about not being sat next to your friend, so the main reason to book a seat is for personal preferences. 

                        Do you want the window seat, or do you feel more comfortable in the aisle? Do you want to be near the bathroom or need extra leg room? These are all the things to consider for relaxing airplane travel. If you aren’t bothered, then save the money and they’ll randomly allocate you. In my experience, most airlines put solo travellers by the window by default.
                        <h4>Make sure to schedule enough time for stopovers</h4>
                        This is a big one: Your perfect flight has a stopover and I know when you’re flying alone for the first time it can be a bit intimidating. But as long as you follow these tips for first time flyers, you’ll be fine. When you’re booking, you can see how long you’ve got between flights.

Never book if it’s less than 1.5 hours, and book at least 3 hours for the US where there’s extra security.

There is genuinely nothing more stressful than running through the airport not really knowing where to go with minimal time for your flight. Bear in mind if you’re coming from a non-EU-country, you’ll need to check in your carry-on bag again and there might be a long line so give yourself plenty of time. For instance, when I flew from Armenia (non-EU) with a stop-over in Warsaw, we got off the the plane and had to go through a security and passport check before we could head to our gate.  
                        <h4>Pack well in advance</h4>
                        While it may be tempting to leave all your packing to the last minute, don’t make this when flying alone for the first time. It’ll help relieve your general anxiety if you know you have everything you need ready. Make sure you’ve got plenty of things to distract you on the flight in your hand luggage.
                        <h4>Wear comfortable clothes</h4>
                        Yes, you’ve seen all those Instagrammers in their heels and tight skinny-jeans ready for take-off. And if you want to do that, that’s totally fine but it’s so much nicer travelling in your favourite comfy clothes. That doesn’t mean you have to look sloppy but definitely avoid anything majorly tight or anything that has awkward buckles or buttons.
                        <h4>Luggage check-in</h4>
                        If you’ve checked in online then go to the counter for your airline and flight and look for the sign which says, ‘baggage drop-off’. Follow the instructions there. There’s usually someone there to help out. If you haven’t checked in online, then go to the counter with your luggage and check yourself and your bag in at the same time.

If you only have hand luggage and have already checked in, then just go on through; you don’t have to go to the counter at all.
                        <h4>Pick up your luggage</h4>
                        And that’s it. You survived your first time flying alone – yaay! Now it’s time to pick up your luggage and enjoy your holiday. Come off the flight and go through immigration and passport control. Once you’re through, follow the signs for ‘baggage claim’.

There’ll be screens with lots of flights and times on, find your flight and make note of the number it says. Find the carousel with the matching number and wait for your luggage to come around. This can sometimes take a while.

                        Going on a trip is nice. There’s a big, soft spot in my heart for all inclusive resorts, ski in/out chalets, and tightly organized tours. But going on trips is not quite the same as true traveling. While the former is mostly associated with leisure, the latter requires a special sense of adventure, resilience and strength of character. I believe there are several traits and mindsets that every one of us who sets out to travel must be equipped with if we’re going to get the most out of our journeys.

                        <h4>Sense of humor</h4> While glorious sunsets, desert tours, and five-star dining are delightful, the true traveler understands that language barriers, upset stomachs, missed connections, and a multitude of other mishaps are the real stuff a travel legend is made of. I firmly believe in prioritizing health and safety, but at the end of the day, life happens. Once you make it through a storm, don’t hang on to your frustrations. Learn to find the comedy in your less than shining moments. Appreciate them for the lessons they teach you and for the stories they’ll become, and make your way to the next adventure along your path.

                        <h4>Humility</h4> You’re awesome—we know this to be true. You’ve taken hold of the reigns of your life and decided to traverse the globe, and you have every right to be proud of that. But, the people in the places you’re visiting also have every right to keep on keeping on as they were, long before you and all your admittedly awesome ways arrived.  True travel isn’t so much about your fabulous itinerary as much as it is about how you learn to interact with the environments you go into.

                        Take a beat and observe the customs and everyday ebb and flow of your new locale. Ask questions. Be willing to try some new things, to make some mistakes and to learn from them.

                        Let people show you what makes them so proud about their culture, and be appreciative of the time they’ve taken to show you. When you do you’ll find a world of genuineness open up to you, and you’ll have a much greater access to even more of the things that you likely traveled to discover in the first place.

                        <h4>Creativity</h4>If life hands you lemons, travel can dump the whole orchard on you. There’s just no way to predict so many things that may happen to you when you’re away from home. As such, resourcefulness and creativity are must have traits in any traveler’s toolkit. Instead of fretting over details that haven’t gone according to your plan, try to embrace the opportunities to think on your feet. The more comfortable you become being uncomfortable, the more you’ll be able to get out of the experiences you’re going to encounter. Chances are you’ll find yourself not just surviving, but thriving in those unexpected situations.
                        <h4>Open mindedness</h4>I’m learning to lay down whatever pre-conceived notions I may enter my travels with.The moments that stick with me most from my travels aren’t the times I’ve learned about cultural differences. There are the times I’ve seen the simplest, sweetest similarities between people.

                        You don’t have to understand or accept every aspect of every culture, nor do you need to change your world view every time you disembark at a new locale.
                        
                        Sometimes it’s just nice to gain an appreciation for another perspective, and see that there’s far more that connects us than divides us. In that sense, you can take a little of each place you go with you in the form of a renewed way of seeing the world and the people in it.
