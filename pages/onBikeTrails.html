                        The picturesque villages which are imbued with 
                        the expanses of cultivated fields and green 
                        wine-growing hills are characteristic of Slavonia, 
                        Baranja and western Syrmia just like the folk 
                        dances – the kolo, the bećarac, the sound of 
                        the tambura and the luxurious embroidery, 
                        crocheting and ducats of the decorated women’s 
                        folk costume and the distinctly decorated, 
                        woollen coats – known as reklje or špenzle, 
                        which originate from the Slavonian military 
                        guard’s uniform from the beginning of 
                        the 18th century, the boots and the integral 
                        Slavonian šokački hat are decorations from 
                        the men's folk costume.<br><br>
                        With regards to cycling, Osijek is the Slavonian 
                        city of bicycles where you can feel like 
                        “a king on a bike” because it has the most 
                        kilometres of cycling paths and the best way 
                        to really get to know it is by bicycle. It 
                        is a city of a harmoniously connected baroque 
                        urban centre and a military fort from the 
                        beginning of the 18th century which gives 
                        it a special charm. The Osijek promenade along 
                        the Drava is in its entirety a cycling path. 
                        Along it you can reach the ferry known as 
                        ‘Kompa’ on the Drava, then over the river 
                        to the zoo and back via one of the two bridges 
                        enjoying the beautiful views of the city.<br><br>
                        Within reach of Osijek is the Kopački Rit Nature Park, 
                        one of the largest wetland areas in Europe. 
                        The most beautiful way to spend time in this 
                        attractive park is by bike exploring the numerous 
                        canals and lakes full of birdlife for which it is 
                        widely recognised as being amongst the greatest 
                        attractions of UNESCO’s transboundary 
                        Mura-Drava-Danube biosphere reserve. 
                        Using the embankment along the canal 
                        which connects Veliki Sakadaš and the 
                        River Drava it is possible, by trekking 
                        or MTB on the relatively good macadam, 
                        to circularly connect the nature park 
                        and the city of Osijek.
