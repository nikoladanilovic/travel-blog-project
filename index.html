                    London is very beautiful city, one of the biggest cities in Europe, and it has so much
                    to offer. It has a lot of museums, galleries and monumental buildings and it would take
                    a lot of time to visit them all, so I just explored few of those.<br><br>
                    What I liked the most about my trip to London is beautiful siluette of 
                    the city when looking from the river Thames and also I liked British Museum
                    which has collections of beautiful artifacts from all around the world.

                    While in India I visited the city of Varanasi. It is a city with rich
                    historical and religious background. Varanasi grew as an important industrial 
                    centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, 
                    and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here 
                    around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion 
                    of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious 
                    importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara 
                    established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. 
                    During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city continued 
                    as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and 
                    poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of 
                    cultural importance and religious education.

                        Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, 
                        with a population of 2,148,271 residents 
                        in an area of 105 square kilometres.
                        Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's 
                        major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, 
                        science and the arts. The City of Paris is the centre and 
                        seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, 
                        which has an estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210, 
                        or about 18 percent of the population of France. The 
                        Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) 
                        in 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence 
                        Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, 
                        Paris was the second most expensive city in the 
                        world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, 
                        Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva. Another source 
                        ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore 
                        and Hong Kong, in 2018.

                        Bangkok is beautiful city which traces it's roots  to a small 
                        trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century.
                        Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later 
                        renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, 
                        as the country faced pressures from the West. 
                        The city was at the centre of Thailand's political 
                        struggles throughout the 20th century, as the 
                        country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted 
                        constitutional rule, and underwent numerous 
                        coups and several uprisings. The city grew 
                        rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s 
                        and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's 
                        politics, economy, education, media and modern 
                        society.<br><br>
                        The city is known for its street life and cultural 
                        landmarks, as well as its red-light districts. 
                        The Grand Palace and Buddhist temples including 
                        Wat Arun and Wat Pho stand in contrast with 
                        other tourist attractions such as the nightlife 
                        scenes of Khaosan Road and Patpong. Bangkok 
                        is among the world's top tourist destinations, 
                        and has been named the world's most visited 
                        city consistently in several international rankings.
